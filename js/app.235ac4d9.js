Qualitatively, the procedure is as follows: The sender learns the first bit of the password ($A$ for example) and sends it to the receiver repeatedly. Once a bit makes it through, the receiver writes the bit to its own password tape and returns a bit repeatedly stating that it knows the bit ($K_rA$). Once the sender receives ($K_rA$), it stops sending ($A$) bits and starts sending ($K_sK_rA$) bits, acknowledging that the the sender knows the receiver knows the initial bit. When the receiver receives ($K_sK_rA$), it stops sending ($K_rA$) bits and starts sending ($K_rK_sK_rA$) bits. Finally, once the sender receives a ($K_rK_sK_rA$) bit, it can be sure its initial bit has been correctly received ($K_sK_rK_sK_rA$). Now the sender may stop sending ($K_sK_rA$) and start sending the next bit from the password. \\hl{[include psuedo code from text book?]} Notice this protocol is safe from something like deletion errors.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? ",-1),N=Object(o["f"])("p",null," On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
